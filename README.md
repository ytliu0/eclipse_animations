# Maps and Animations for Solar Eclipses 

[Project homepage](https://ytliu0.github.io/eclipse_animations)

This project was created to provide additional maps and animations to my [Eight Millennia of Eclipses site](http:ytliu.epizy.com/eclipse/) for a few selected solar eclipses.

## Acknowledgments

The eclipse data here are generated by the same code I developed for my [Eight Millennia of Eclipses website](http:ytliu.epizy.com/eclipse/) using algorithms described in *Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac (3rd edition)* and *Elements of Solar Eclipses 1951 - 2200*. The center-of-mass positions of the Sun and Moon are calculated using the JPL DE431 or DE441 ephemerides. Lunar-limb corrections are calculated based on the data from the [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter](https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Orthographic maps are generated using the [GeoViews](https://geoviews.org/) Python library. Local maps are based on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps). 

## Terms of Use

Permission is granted to use the maps and animations in this project provided they are not altered (except for re-sizing) and the embedded credit line is not removed or covered. Proper credits should be given with a link to the [project page](https://ytliu0.github.io/eclipse_animations).
