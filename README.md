# Maps and Animations for Solar Eclipses in 2023 and 2024

[Project homepage](https://ytliu0.github.io/eclipse_animations)

This project was created to provide additional maps and animations to my [Eight Millennia of Eclipses site](http:ytliu.epizy.com/eclipse/) for the annular solar eclipse on October 14, 2023 and total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. Both eclipses will be visible in North American and the paths of annularity and totality will pass through the continental United States.

## Acknowledgments

The eclipse data here are generated by the same code I developed for my [Eight Millennia of Eclipses website](http:ytliu.epizy.com/eclipse/) using algorithms described in *Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac (3rd edition)* and *Elements of Solar Eclipses 1951 - 2200*. The center-of-mass positions of the Sun and Moon are calculated using the JPL DE431 or DE441 ephemerides. Lunar-limb corrections are not included. Orthographic maps are generated using the [GeoViews](https://geoviews.org/) Python library. Local maps are based on the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) and [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps). 

## Terms of Use

Permission is granted to use the maps and animations in this project provided they are not altered (except for re-sizing) and the embedded credit line is not removed or covered. Proper credits should be given with a link to the [project page](https://ytliu0.github.io/eclipse_animations). If you use any map based on the OpenStreetMap or Google Maps, a link to their copyright and license page should also be included.
