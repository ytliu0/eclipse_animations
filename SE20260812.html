Partial eclipses are visible in northern Russia, Alaska, Canada, northern United States, Greenland, most of Europe and West Africa.</p><p>Total solar eclipse is visible at locations at which Moon's umbra (Moon's dark shadow) passes through. Moon's umbra appears on Earth at 16:58 UT in northeastern Russia. It moves in the northwest direction, reaching about 100km from the north pole around 17:06 UT before turning southward and reaching Greenland six minutes later. At 17:27 UT, the central line reaches the westernmost longitude in eastern Greeland and then turns southeastward. The umbra passes over western Iceland between 17:44 and 17:50 UT. It continues to move southeastward in the North Atlantic Ocean and passes through many regions in Spain between 18:27 and 18:33 UT. The umbra leaves the Earth at 18:34 UT in the Mediterranean Sea close to the north coast of Algeria.</p><div style="border:1px solid #000;padding:10px"><p><b>Contents</b></p><ul><li><a href="#globalView">Global View</a></li><ul><li><a href="#orthographicMap">Orthographic Map</a></li><li><a href="#orthographicAnimation">Animation</a></li></ul><li><a href="#umbraPath">Path of Totality</a></li><ul><li><a href="#umbraMaps">Maps</a></li><li><a href="#umbraAnimation">Animation</a></li></ul><li><a href="#localCircum">Local Circumstances</a></li><li><a href="#acknowledgements">Acknowledgments</a></li></ul></div><br><hr><h2 id="globalView">Global View</h2><h3 id="orthographicMap">Orthographic Map</h3><p><img src="png/SE20260812_orthomap.png" alt="Orthographic eclipse map"></p><p>In this orthographic map, the red dot at the center is the location of the greatest eclipse, where Moon's shadow axis is closest to the geocenter. The black dot is the north pole. The purple line is the limit of Moon's penumbra. The three blue lines across the map center are the northern limit of umbra (right line), central line (middle line), and southern limit of umbra (left line). Note that the north and south here refers to the direction in the <a href="http://ytliu.epizy.com/eclipse/Besselian_solar.html" target="_blank">fundamental coordinate system</a>, which in this eclipse is opposite to the geographic north and south direction in the beginning of the umbra path. Total solar eclipse is visible inside the narrow strip bounded by the northern and southern limits of umbra. The brown line is the locus of points where eclipse begins/ends at Sunrise (upper-left part) or Sunset (lower-right part). The middle red line is the locus of points where the maximum eclipse occurs at Sunrise (upper-left part) or Sunset (lower-right part). No eclipse is visible beyond the region bounded by the brown and purple lines. The orange red lines with the same shape as the penumbra limits are lines of equal eclipse magnitude, and the magnitude is indicated (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%) around each line.</p><br><h3 id="orthographicAnimation">Animation</h3><p><video controls><source src="mp4/SE2026-08-12_690.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p><p>In this animation, the green region is Moon's penumbra.
